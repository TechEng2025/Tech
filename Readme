test A memory leak is a situation where a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations, leading to memory waste and potential performance issues.

*Memory Leak in Java*

In Java, memory leaks occur when objects are no longer needed but still retain memory, preventing the garbage collector from reclaiming it.

*Types of Memory Leaks in Java*

1. Static Variables
2. Unclosed Resources
3. Circular References
4. Inner Class References
5. Hash Map Issues
6. Database Connection Leaks
7. File Handle Leaks
8. Thread Locals

*Causes of Memory Leaks in Java*

1. Poor coding practices
2. Incorrect usage of static variables
3. Unclosed database connections or file handles
4. Circular object references
5. Incorrect usage of thread locals

*Symptoms of Memory Leaks in Java*

1. Increasing memory usage
2. Slow application performance
3. OutOfMemoryError exceptions
4. Frequent garbage collection

*Prevention and Detection*

1. Use profiling tools (e.g., VisualVM, Eclipse Memory Analyzer)
2. Monitor memory usage and garbage collection
3. Implement weak references
4. Avoid static variables
5. Close resources promptly
6. Use Java 14+ records for efficient memory usage

*Tools for Detecting Memory Leaks in Java*

1. VisualVM
2. Eclipse Memory Analyzer Tool (MAT)
3. Java Mission Control (JMC)
4. YourKit Profiler
5. JProfiler
